## Array Visualizer

This page contains only one major component, called the Array Visualizer. This component is supposed to help in visualizing the kinds kinds of objects you can put into an array.

The visualizer renders the same amount of objects as the array that is fed into it, displays the index of each objects, and shows what properties each objects has. To simplify, it can only take one type of object, which displays a shape (star, square, triangle, circle), a color (for the shape) and a value (a number in the middle of the shape).

The user can click on each of these items to open up an option menu and change the shape, color and value of these objects. Only one option menu per object can be open at a time. When you change the options, the array updates in real time.
